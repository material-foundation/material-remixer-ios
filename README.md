Remixer is a framework to iterate quickly on UI changes by allowing you to adjust UI variables without needing to rebuild (or even restart) your app. You can adjust Numbers, Colors, Booleans, and Strings. To see it in action check out the [example app](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-remixer-ios/tree/develop/examples/objc).

If you are interested in using Remixer in another platform, you may want to check out the [Android](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-remixer-android) and [Javascript](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-remixer-js) repos. With any of the three platforms you can use the [Remote Controller](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-remixer-remote-web).

## Using Remixer in your app

### Requirements

- Xcode 7.0 or higher.
- iOS 8.0 or higher.

## Quickstart

### 1. Install CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is the easiest way to get started. If you're new to CocoaPods,
check out their [getting started documentation](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

To install CocoaPods, run the following command:

~~~ bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
~~~

### 2. Create Podfile

Once you've created an iOS application in Xcode you can start using Remixer for iOS.

To initialize CocoaPods in your project, run the following commands:

~~~ bash
cd your-project-directory
pod init
~~~

### 3. Edit Podfile

Once you've initialized CocoaPods, add the [Remixer iOS Pod](https://cocoapods.org/pods/Remixer)
to your target in your Podfile:

~~~ ruby
target "MyApp" do
  ...
  pod 'Remixer'
end
~~~

Then run the command:

~~~ bash
pod install
open your-project.xcworkspace
~~~

### 4. Add variables

Now you’re ready to add Remixer to your app! Begin by importing the Remixer header and call |attachToKeyWindow| in your AppDelegate:

~~~ objc
#import "Remixer.h"

@implementation AppDelegate

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {

  self.window = [[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame:[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]];
  self.window.rootViewController = [[UIViewController alloc] init];
  [self.window makeKeyAndVisible];
  
  // Let Remixer know that it can attach to the window you just created
  [RMXRemixer attachToKeyWindow];

  return YES;
}

// OPTIONAL: Make sure you propagate these two events if you're using Remote Controllers.
- (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application {
  [RMXRemixer applicationDidBecomeActive];
}
- (void)applicationWillResignActive:(UIApplication *)application {
  [RMXRemixer applicationWillResignActive];
}

@end
~~~

Now you can add Remixer variables in your view controllers as follows:

~~~ objc
#import "Remixer.h"

@implementation ExampleViewController {
  UIView *_box;
  RMXColorVariable *_bgColorVariable;
}

- (void)viewWillAppear {
  // IMPORTANT: Create a weak reference to self to be used inside of the update block
  __weak ExampleViewController *weakSelf = self;
  // Add a color variable to control the background color of the box.  
  _bgColorVariable =
      [RMXColorVariable
          colorVariableWithKey:@"boxBgColor"
                  defaultValue:[UIColor redColor]
               limitedToValues:@[[UIColor redColor], [UIColor blueColor], [UIColor yellowColor]]
                   updateBlock:^(RMXColorVariable *variable, UIColor *selectedValue) {
                     weakSelf.box.backgroundColor = selectedValue;
                   }];
}

- (void)viewWillDisappear {
  // This is optional but it will make sure the variable is removed from the overlay when
  // you push view controllers on top of this one.
  _bgColorVariable = nil;
}
~~~
Make sure you keep a reference to the variables you create, otherwise they will get removed automatically.

### 5. Refine their values

Run the app and swipe up with 3 fingers (or 2 if you're using the simulator). This will trigger the Remixer overlay. From here you can see the variables your app is using, and refine their values.
